# About Kuzzle

For UI and linked objects developers, Kuzzle is an open-source solution that handles all the data management
(CRUD, real-time storage, search, high-level features, etc;).

Kuzzle features are accessible through a secured API. It can be used through a large choice of protocols such as REST, Websocket or Message Queuing protocols.

# Installation

## With docker, from scratch

You can use the `docker-compose/all.yml` which will run all Kuzzle stack and the BO.

    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose/all.yml up

If you want to customize which service to launch or if you don't want to clone the repo, you can create your own docker-compose.yml file.
If you want to communicate with Kuzzle in Stomp or AMQ, you probably want to add a service rabbitMQ.

**Note:** For more information about how to install Kuzzle, you can check [this documentation](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle/blob/master/docs/installation.md)

## With docker with an already running Kuzzle

You can run the back office using the Kuzzle BO image with a link to your Kuzzle instance

    $ docker run --link my-kuzzle-container-name:kuzzle -p 3000:3000 kuzzleio/bo

Where `my-kuzzle-container-name` is the container name where your Kuzzle is running. If you are in trouble for get your container name you can retrieve it with

    $ docker ps | grep kuzzleio/kuzzle

The container name is in the last column.

**Note:**
* If you want to debug, you also have to expose the port 8080
* For more information about how to install Kuzzle, you can check [this documentation](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle/blob/master/docs/installation.md)

# Running Tests

    $ npm test

Because functional tests need to be done in a running Kuzzle environment, it is recommended to run these tests from a Kuzzle container.

Using Compose:

```
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose/test.yml up
```
